# Youtube Download Web App

I used Pytube and Flask to make a web app that allows you to paste a YouTube link and download it as an audio file or as a video at different resolutions.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.

2. Create a new virtual environment

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the requirements.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the app.

```bash
$ flask --debug run
```
